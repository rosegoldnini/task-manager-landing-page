# Task Manager Company Landing Page

This website and everything related to this repository is just part of my online course called Software Development Skills:Front-end from LUT University

This project uses and is inspired from the Youtube tutorial from [Traversy Media](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXYZxVbWkjc&t=8080s), images and logo from free [Task Management Web App](https://www.figma.com/design/6DhqSavzP4IflYuEltKHOw/Task--Management--Web-App-Design--Community-?node-id=0-1&p=f&t=f24PyTCDc3MnCI7a-0) and a loose inspiration from a [Landing Page Template]
(DECLARATION OF AI USAGE - I have used Claude AI for 1 section and 1 part - features section and animation part respectively.)

How to actually run the project:
(Ignoring exercise-materials folder), simply just go to index.html, copy the link (should be something similar like https://github.com/rosegoldnini/main/index.html) and then paste the link onto this website https://htmlpreview.github.io  in order to run it
Or another, easier option is go through this deployed website via Netlify: https://steady-frangollo-c23bb7.netlify.app
